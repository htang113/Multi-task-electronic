# Multi-task-electronic
This package provides a python realization of the multi-task EGNN (equivariant graph neural network) for molecular electronic structure described in the paper "Multi-task learning for molecular electronic structure approaching coupled-cluster accuracy".

1. System requirements

The package works in Linux and Windows systems. The following packages need to be installed in advance:

python==3.10.13
numpy=1.26.4
scipy==1.12.0
matplotlib==3.9.0
torch==2.1.0
torch_cluster==1.6.3
torch_scatter==2.1.2
e3nn==0.5.1
sympy==1.13.0

nvidia-dali-cuda120==1.35.0  (required for using GPU in the calculation)

Note that in most cases, different version of packages should also work. We list exactly the versions in our calculations in case version inconsistency issue occurs. If users intend to run the program on a cpu device, the cuda package is not needed.

2. Installation

No installation process is needed before running the calculation. After downloading the whole repository, calculations can be run in the folder. 
For example, one can launch the model training process using "python3 train_serial.py" in the terminal for Linux devices.
